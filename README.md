Hi!
When you compile my code, it says that I have repeated definitions for my movie, book, and clothing classes.
I'm not sure why this is the case, I needed to make overridden definitions for my derived classes.
Also, amazon.cpp isn't compiling due to the datastore that we have to do next week
I hope these shouldn't be a problem :)
